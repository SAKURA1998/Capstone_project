Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    42 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  42
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         66 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       59 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              32
      Number using O5 and O6:                   27
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         7
  Number of route-thrus:                         7
    Number using O6 output only:                 7

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    59 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           80
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            38 out of      80   47%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  14 out of      80   17%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          28 out of      80   35%
    Number of unique control sets:              33
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              90 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         8 out of     480    1%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        8 out of       8  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.23
