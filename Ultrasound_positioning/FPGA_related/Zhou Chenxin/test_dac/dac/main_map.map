Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    75 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  75
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        146 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      142 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              67
      Number using O5 output only:              62
      Number using O5 and O6:                   13
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         4
  Number of route-thrus:                        66
    Number using O6 output only:                66

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    44 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          147
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            72 out of     147   48%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   1 out of     147    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          74 out of     147   50%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         6 out of     480    1%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        6 out of       6  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        3

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.69
