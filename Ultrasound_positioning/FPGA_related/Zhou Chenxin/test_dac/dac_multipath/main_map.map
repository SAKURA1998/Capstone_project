  Number of Slice Registers:                   203 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 203
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        292 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      284 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             180
      Number using O5 output only:              64
      Number using O5 and O6:                   40
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         8
  Number of route-thrus:                        72
    Number using O6 output only:                72

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    85 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          293
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            90 out of     293   30%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   1 out of     293    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         202 out of     293   68%
    Number of unique control sets:              10
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         6 out of     480    1%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        6 out of       6  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2
