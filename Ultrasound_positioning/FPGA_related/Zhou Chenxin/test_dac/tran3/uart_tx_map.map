Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    38 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  38
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         85 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       84 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              53
      Number using O5 output only:              30
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        31
    Number using O6 output only:                31

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    24 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           85
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            47 out of      85   55%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      85    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          38 out of      85   44%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        13 out of     480    2%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.76

Peak Memory Usage:  560 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  22 secs
